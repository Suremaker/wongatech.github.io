## Posting content
The _posts folder is where blog posts live. These files are generally Markdown or HTML.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
   
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
   
At a minimum all posts should start with:

`---
layout: post
title: Replace with the title of your post
---`
