This week we hosted the [London PhoneGap Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/londonphonegap/events/204412492/) at the Wonga offices in London.

[PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) allows us to build mobile apps for many different platforms using HTML. Lots of our developers already know HTML and native development has a steep learning curve, so this is a big win for us.

The London PhoneGap Meetup is a regular get together for developers using PhoneGap. It’s a place for us to share ideas and techniques and to discuss ways to make building mobile apps even easier.

This month we had 3 talks:

- I talked about [testing hybrid mobile apps using Appium](http://afternoon.github.io/testing-hybrid-apps-with-appium/). I built a simple example app and a test using Appium. You can see [my sample Appium code on GitHub](https://github.com/afternoon/testing-hybrid-apps-with-appium).
- Yacine Rezgui talked about [FirefoxOS “the perfect web mobile system”](http://slides.com/yacinerezgui/firefox-os-the-perfect-web-mobile-system), FirefoxOS is a new open-source mobile OS aimed initially at low-end smartphones. All FirefoxOS apps are built in HTML, so it’s very interesting to PhoneGap developers.
- Sani Yusuf talked about the [history of PhoneGap and some frameworks for mobile app development](http://slides.com/saniyusuf/phonegapfw). Frameworks do some of the hard work for us, saving time and hassle. At Wonga we’re using the [Angular](http://angularjs.org) framework.

On September 30th, we’ll be hosting the next [AngularJS London meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-London/events/205117592/). I’ll be talking in detail about acceptance testing with [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/) and [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor).
